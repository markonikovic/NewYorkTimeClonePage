## NYT Clone

> This is our third project as Microverse students, we structured and styled a good looking copy of a New York Times's article page. The point of the project is to exercise position elements, styling and embedding images and videos. We used the CSS Grid to give a structure the page, for navigation-bar and aside section flex-box, for pre-footer and picture area we used floats. We embedded imates and a video, used semantic HTML tags. We followed the GitHub work-flow, and commited meaningful commit messages.
