## NYT Clone

> This is our third project as mkicroverse students, we structured and styled a good looking copy of a New York Times's article page.
We used the CSS Grid to give a structure to the page, for navigation-bar and aside section flex-box, for pre-footer and picture area we used floats. The main idea of the project is to practice positioning the elements on the page.
